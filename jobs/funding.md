## Undergraduate
{:data-magellan-destination="undergraduate"}

  * If you are a low-income, first-generation, or underrepresented minority undergraduate you might be able to get funding through the [McNair Program](http://www.rochester.edu/college/kearnscenter/mcnairmain.html) to do a semester-long mentored research project, which also helps with preparing to apply to graduate school.
  * [Glamour Top 10 College Women Prize](http://www.glamour.com/about/top-10-college-women)
  * [Josephine de Karman Fellowship](http://www.dekarman.org/)
  * The department-internal Bishop and Bilski-Mayer fellowships for excellence in undergraduate research typically provide between $1,500 to $5000 to pursue your own summer or semester research project under the guidance of one or several advisors. You need to be nominated by a faculty and you should have worked in a lab already.
  * The UR [Discover Grant program](http://www.rochester.edu/college/ugresearch/discover.html) is a new research grant program aimed at increasing and enhancing the undergraduate research opportunities for current University of Rochester students, open to proposals from individual and groups of current University of Rochester students and faculty.
  * [Summer Scholars Program](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/summer-scholars.aspx)
at [URMC](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/) is a 10 week summer program for
undergraduate students interested in the PhD degree in the Biological or Biomedical
Sciences and for students with a potential interest in attending graduate school
at the University of Rochester. You will learn to prep a research abstract and
create a poster, and have the option to do a GRE prep course. Open to sophomores
and juniors with at least a 3.0 GPA. Must be a US citizen or have a current F1 Visa.
  * [REACH](http://www.rochester.edu/careercenter/students/internship/reach/) funds
from the University of Rochester provide money to current UR students for a summer
internship. On the same page, current UR students can also apply for a Discover Grant
to pay for undergraduate research.

## Graduate
{:data-magellan-destination="graduate"}

Graduate students in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester
are funded via a mixture of training grants, university fellowships, and individual
research grants. All graduate students in the program are guaranteed 5 years of
funding (graduate students are expected to work as a teaching assistant to BCS
classes 3 of the 10 semesters). Post-doctoral fellows are funding via training
grants through the department or research grants.

  * [NIH post-doctoral and graduate fellowships](http://grants.nih.gov/training/extramural.htm)
  provide generous funding for research at US research universities (see also the
  career development grants). You can apply for funding for your own project at
  potentially multiple institutions.These fellowships are also available to non-US
  citizens. Most of these fellowships do, however, have a strong focus on life
  and health sciences.
  * [Human Frontier Science](http://www.hfsp.org/about/AboutProg.php) post-doctoral
  fellowships for international collaborations and post-doc from other countries
  coming to the US (for at least part of their post-doc) or US citizens going abroad.
  HFS also provides career development and young faculty grants, as well as regular
  research grants of up to $US450,000 per year. HFS is focused on funding research
  in the life sciences (including e.g. chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering).
  * [Searle scholars program](http://www.searlescholars.net/) young researchers
  grants for research in the biomedical sciences and chemistry: .
  * [Computing Innovations Fellows Project](http://cifellows.org/) provides funding
  for one or two year postdocs in computing fields. [Our CI Fellows page](http://cifellows.org/match/t-florian-jaeger-at-human-language-lab-brain-and-cognitive-sciences-and-computer-science-university-of-rochester/)
  * If you're from Germany, you may consider the [DAAD](http://www.daad.org/) short-term
  visiting grants for graduate students and post-docs.
  * [The Jacob K. Javits Fellowships Program](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/jacobjavits/index.html)
  provides fellowships to students of superior academic ability—selected on the
  basis of demonstrated achievement, financial need, and exceptional promise—to
  undertake study at the doctoral and Master of Fine Arts level in selected fields
  of arts, humanities, and social sciences.
  * [Ford Foundation Fellowships Programs](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm).
  Predoctoral, Dissertation, and Postdoctoral fellowships available.
  * [Visits and research collaborations to HLP Lab for WUN members](http://www.rochester.edu/research/icf/)

### For early graduate school

  * [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/). These are given
  based on research experience, promise of the proposed research program, and broader
  impact, such as community involvement, teaching, etc. (yes, they actually pay
  attention to that). If you decide to take a year or two off before applying
  to Ph.D. programs, you can still apply for nationally competitive graduate-study
  fellowships. They are not deferrable, so you'd wait to apply for them in the
  fall that you also plan to submit your graduate admission applications.
  * Howard Hughes Medical Institute [International Student Research Fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/grants/individuals/intl_fellows.html).
  Three year fellowship for international students (in biomedical-related fields
    including biology, chemistry, physics, math, computer science, engineering,
    and plant biology—as well as interdisciplinary research). Open to 2nd or 3rd
    year PhD students who are ineligible for fellowships or training grants
    through U.S. federal agencies.


### Proposal and dissertation funding

  * The Office of Faculty Development and Diversity at UR has a [website with basic
  information that may be useful to PIs in proposal preparation](http://www.rochester.edu/diversity/grantresources/index.html),
   particularly those opportunities that encourage underrepresented minority
   recruitment and broader impact vis a vis diversity.
