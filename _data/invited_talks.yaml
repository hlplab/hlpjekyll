    title: Expectations and adaptation in prosodic processing
    abstract: >
      Prosody - the rhythm, intensity, and intonation of speech - is a crucial
      aspect of human communication. However, there are still many questions as
      to how listeners process and represent prosodic information. Prosodic
      processing has usually been thought of as a mainly bottom-up process, where
      listeners hear cues and build up their prosodic representations based on
      this acoustic information. However, because prosody signals information
      about many other levels of language processing (e.g., syntax, pragmatics,
      meta-linguistic), it is likely that these other levels of language processing
      might affect how listeners interpret prosodic information. We decided to
      study this possibility by investigating the relationship between prosodic
      and syntactic processing. In a series of studies, we explored how listeners’
      representation of prosodic boundaries were affected by their expectations
      as to where these boundaries should occur given the syntactic structure of
      the sentence they heard. We find that listeners are most likely to report
      boundaries at locations where they were more syntactically plausible, despite
      the acoustic information they received in the message. Additionally, we explore
      whether listeners can adapt to new prosody-syntax mappings after being given
      feedback based on their interpretations of ambiguous sentences. Our results
      suggest that listeners are able to adapt to novel (even contradictory)
      prosody-syntax mappings after enough exposure. Together, these series of
      studies shed light on how listeners process prosodic information, suggesting
      that prosodic representations are somewhat flexible, and are influenced by
      listeners’ expectations and experience with language.

      Uniformity in talker-specific phonetic realization: Evidence from sibilant
      fricatives in American English and Czech
    abstract: >
      The acoustic-phonetic properties of speech sounds vary substantially across
      languages, and even across talkers within a single language. There is, however,
      considerable evidence that phonetic properties that the realizations of different
      speech sounds do not vary independently but are highly structured (mutually
      predictable). Evidence for structured variation of this type can be found
      in the covariation of vowels in the F1xF2 plane, with talkers forming relatively
      congruent but shifted formant patterns, but shifted vowel spaces (e.g., Joos,
      1948; Nearey, 1978), and covariation of voice onset time (VOT), as talkers
      primarily differ in overall mean VOT, especially among the aspirated stops
      [pʰ tʰ kʰ] (e.g., Chodroff & Wilson, 2017). Cases of structured variation
      reveal that there are constraints on phonetic variation in language- and
      talker-specific sound systems (e.g., Liljencrants & Lindblom, 1972).
      This talk examines the predictions of two uniformity constraints that require
      similar (or uniform) phonetic realization of distinctive features across members
      of a natural class. To evaluate the predictions, I present data on the realization
      of sibilant fricatives across talkers of American English and Czech. The findings
      support the hypothesis that talker variation is highly constrained, and also
      have important implications for rapid perceptual adaptation to novel talkers.

    title: Categorical vs. Episodic Memory for Pitch Accents in American English
    abstract: >
      Phonological accounts of speech perception postulate that listeners map variable
      instances of speech to categorical features and remember only those categories.
      Other research maintains that listeners perceive and remember subcategorical
      phonetic detail. Our study probes memory to investigate the reality of categorical
      encoding for prosody—when listeners hear a pitch accent, what do they remember?
      Two types of prosodic variation are tested: phonological variation (presence
      vs. absence of a pitch accent), and variation in phonetic cues to pitch accent
      (F0 peak, word duration). We report results from six experiments that test
      memory for phonological pitch accent vs. phonetic cues. Our results suggest
      that listeners encode both categorical distinctions and phonetic detail in
      memory, but categorical distinctions are more reliably retrieved than cues
      in later tests of episodic memory. They also show that listeners may vary
      in the degree to which they remember prosodic detail.

      Models of retrieval in sentence comprehension: A computational evaluation
      using Bayesian hierarchical modeling
    abstract: >
      Research on similarity-based interference has provided extensive evidence
      that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a
      cue-based retrieval mechanism. There are two different models that can account
      for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a
      retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval
      cue: Lewis and Vasishth’s (2005) activation-based model and McElree’s (2000)
      direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost
      interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences
      in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The
      activation-based model follows the assumptions of the ACT-R framework, and
      its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of
      evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval
      is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of
      accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory
      where only the probability of retrieval can be affected, while the retrieval
      time is constant; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of
      the possibility of backtracking and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented
      both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them
      and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under
      the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that
      this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving
      as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the
      ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation
      model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of
      incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances
      for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good
      as the one of the direct access model.
