    I'm interested in language adaptation, production, and comprehension, but I haven't narrowed my
    focus much as of yet. Other areas that have caught my curiosity include binomial word order,
    text-setting, and synchronous speech.

    I'm interested in prediction, learning, and adaptation during language comprehension.
    One current line of my research investigates whether people learn abstract linguistic
    constraints through prediction error-based learning. I'm also interested in how
    expectations about upcoming words influence the detail with which we maintain
    representations about the current input.

    I’m interested in predictive processing of language. More specifically, I’m
    interested in when and how people translate higher-level predictions into
    expectations about lower-level features. Besides, I’m also interested in how
    people adjust those higher- and lower-level expectancies in the face of unexpected
    information in the current context (i.e. adaptation). My other interest includes
    how prosodic information is used in language processing, both in speech and in
    silent reading.
