  blurb: >
    I'm interested in language adaptation, production, and comprehension, but I haven't narrowed my
    focus much as of yet. Other areas that have caught my curiosity include binomial word order,
    text-setting, and synchronous speech.

    I'm interested in prediction, learning, and adaptation during language comprehension.
    One current line of my research investigates whether people learn abstract linguistic
    constraints through prediction error-based learning. I'm also interested in how
    expectations about upcoming words influence the detail with which we maintain
    representations about the current input.

    My interests are in phonetic production and variation, audience design and computational models
    of speaker behavior. My current focus is on if speakers behave in a boundedly rational way during
    phonetic production.

    I'm interested in computational modeling and speech perception, and specifically in developing
    models of how phonetic categories are learned and deployed that are plausible from linguistic,
    computational, neural, and developmental perspectives. I'm also interested in how phonetic categories
    interact with lexical representations.

    I am interested in taking computational and experimental approaches to investigate sentence
    comprehension, accent adaptation, and how listeners form structural generalizations across speaker
    groups. I also have interests computational modeling, prosody, and cross-modality/domain work,
    e.g. sign language and music cognition.

  blurb: >
    I'm interested in the kinds of information people take into account when
    comprehending or producing referring expressions. In particular my research
    asks questions about how people generate and constrain alternative
    interpretations, adapt to different speakers and contexts, and how young
    children learn to integrate all of this information in their comprehension
    and productions.

    I am interested in how higher-level implicit knowledge of the sociolinguistic
    distribution of feature variation can affect adaptive strategies in sentence processing.
