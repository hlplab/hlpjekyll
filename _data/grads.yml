  blurb: >
    I'm interested in language adaptation, production, and comprehension, but I haven't narrowed my
    focus much as of yet. Other areas that have caught my curiosity include binomial word order,
    text-setting, and synchronous speech.

    My interests are in phonetic production and variation, audience design and computational models
    of speaker behavior. My current focus is on if speakers behave in a boundedly rational way during
    phonetic production.

  blurb: >
    I'm interested in computational modeling and speech perception, and specifically in developing
    models of how phonetic categories are learned and deployed that are plausible from linguistic,
    computational, neural, and developmental perspectives. I'm also interested in how phonetic categories
    interact with lexical representations.

  blurb: >
    I am interested in taking computational and experimental approaches to investigate sentence
    comprehension, accent adaptation, and how listeners form structural generalizations across speaker
    groups. I also have interests computational modeling, prosody, and cross-modality/domain work,
    e.g. sign language and music cognition.
