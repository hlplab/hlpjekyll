  blurb: >
    I'm interested in language adaptation, production, and comprehension, but I haven't narrowed my
    focus much as of yet. Other areas that have caught my curiosity include binomial word order,
    text-setting, and synchronous speech.

    I'm interested in prediction, learning, and adaptation during language comprehension.
    One current line of my research investigates whether people learn abstract linguistic
    constraints through prediction error-based learning. I'm also interested in how
    expectations about upcoming words influence the detail with which we maintain
    representations about the current input.

    I am interested in taking computational and experimental approaches to investigate sentence
    comprehension, accent adaptation, and how listeners form structural generalizations across speaker
    groups. I also have interests computational modeling, prosody, and cross-modality/domain work,
    e.g. sign language and music cognition.

  blurb: >
    I'm interested in the kinds of information people take into account when
    comprehending or producing referring expressions. In particular my research
    asks questions about how people generate and constrain alternative
    interpretations, adapt to different speakers and contexts, and how young
    children learn to integrate all of this information in their comprehension
    and productions.

    I am interested in how higher-level implicit knowledge of the sociolinguistic
    distribution of feature variation can affect adaptive strategies in sentence processing.

  blurb: >
    I’m interested in predictive processing of language. More specifically, I’m 
    interested in when and how people translate higher-level predictions into 
    expectations about lower-level features. Besides, I’m also interested in how
    people adjust those higher- and lower-level expectancies in the face of unexpected 
    information in the current context (i.e. adaptation). My other interest includes 
    how prosodic information is used in language processing, both in speech and in 
    silent reading.
