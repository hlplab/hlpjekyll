  blurb: >
    I am interested in how production and comprehension complexity (due to locality; expectation)
    influences speakers' choice in language variation. I use psycholinguistic experimentation and
    corpus-based statistical modeling to investigate whether/to what extent speakers use prosodic
    and syntactic cues to make unexpected information easier to process (predictability; information
    structure; common ground), and to which extend this is done for their addressees (audience design).
