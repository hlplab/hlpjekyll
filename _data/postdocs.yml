    I am interested in the cognitive and neural processes underlying speech
    processing, in the context of native and non-native communication. I combine
    psycholinguistic experimentation and functional neuroimaging methods (fMRI;
    recently, learning to apply statistical modeling) in my research to investigate
    how experience-dependent plasticity occurs (perceptual adaptation, long-term
    L2 learning). My most current line of work investigates foreign accent
    adaptation and its generalization across talkers, as well as maintenance over
    time. Broadly, I hope to better understand how people learn and represent
    structured variability (e.g., talker information) in spoken languages and
    the neural mechanisms that support such learning and representations.

  blurb: >
    I am interested in variation and speech processing. My primary line of
    research investigates the cognitive processes by which listeners cope with
    pronunciation variation in order to recognize and comprehend spoken
    language (learning, adaptation, generalization, social inference). I also
    investigate the relationship between language production and language
    processing, particularly how/when people adapt their productions in
    response to other talkers (alignment). To address these issues, I combine
    psycholinguistic experimentation and statistical modeling with tools,
    techniques, and insights from a range of disciplines, including phonetics,
    sociolinguistics, and social psychology.
