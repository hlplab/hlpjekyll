  blurb: >
    I am interested in the cognitive and neural processes underlying speech
    processing, in the context of native and non-native communication. I combine
    psycholinguistic experimentation and functional neuroimaging methods (fMRI;
    recently, learning to apply statistical modeling) in my research to investigate
    how experience-dependent plasticity occurs (perceptual adaptation, long-term
    L2 learning). My most current line of work investigates foreign accent
    adaptation and its generalization across talkers, as well as maintenance over
    time. Broadly, I hope to better understand how people learn and represent
    structured variability (e.g., talker information) in spoken languages and
    the neural mechanisms that support such learning and representations.
