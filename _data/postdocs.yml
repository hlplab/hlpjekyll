  blurb: >
    I am interested in variation and speech processing. My primary line of
    research investigates the cognitive processes by which listeners cope with
    pronunciation variation in order to recognize and comprehend spoken
    language (learning, adaptation, generalization, social inference). I also
    investigate the relationship between language production and language
    processing, particularly how/when people adapt their productions in
    response to other talkers (alignment). To address these issues, I combine
    psycholinguistic experimentation and statistical modeling with tools,
    techniques, and insights from a range of disciplines, including phonetics,
    sociolinguistics, and social psychology.
