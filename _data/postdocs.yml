    I’m interested in what speech and prosody — the rhythm, intonation, and 
    intensity of speech — reveal about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie 
    language production, comprehension, and acquisition. An ongoing goal of mine
    has been to develop computational models of prosodic production and 
    comprehension. My latest research focuses on how listeners integrate 
    information from a variety of (often noisy) cues, and on how people learn 
    to understand and produce constructions that are not already familiar to 
    them (e.g., new uses of prosody, pronunciations that are not native to their
    language, etc.).

    I am interested in the cognitive and neural processes underlying speech
    processing, in the context of native and non-native communication. I combine
    psycholinguistic experimentation and functional neuroimaging methods (fMRI;
    recently, learning to apply statistical modeling) in my research to investigate
    how experience-dependent plasticity occurs (perceptual adaptation, long-term
    L2 learning). My most current line of work investigates foreign accent
    adaptation and its generalization across talkers, as well as maintenance over
    time. Broadly, I hope to better understand how people learn and represent
    structured variability (e.g., talker information) in spoken languages and
    the neural mechanisms that support such learning and representations.
