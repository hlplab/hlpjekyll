    I came to the lab in 2007 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Linguistics
    and a Masters in Linguistics from The Ohio State Univeristy. My primary responsibilities
    are maintaining the computing environment and webpage, programming experiments
    (for in the lab and on the web), providing programming assitance, and just plain
    programming.

    I am a graduate from the University of Rochester with a BA degree in Russian
    and Linguistics. I was introduced to research when I started volunteering
    for Chigusa Kurumada collecting child prosody data and have been working in
    the lab since. I am currently a lab manager for the Rochester Kinderlab and
    the Human Language Processing lab. Current projects are building a tutorial
    for BCS 152: Introduction to Psycholinguistics and helping to set up the
    Kinderlab. I will be pursing a Masters degree this upcoming Fall (2015).
