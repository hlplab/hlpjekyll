    I came to the lab to study second language learnability depending on language
    background and other factors such as age and exposure. The larger the linguistic
    gaps learners need to bridge, the lower the learnability. We adopted a large-scale
    approach, making use of testing scores, typological data, and mixed effects
    regression modeling.

    In my research project I investigate the role of discourse markers of expectation
    (such as actually, in fact, indeed, of course) in incremental sentence processing,
    using eye tracking (visual world) and EEG. During my stay in Rochester I would
    like to present my project plans and discuss my experimental designs. Also ,
    I will possibly run an EEG study on the influence of language on object perception
    (as part of a joined project with Monique Flecken).

  blurb: >
    During my visit at the Human Language Processing Lab, I'm planning to run a
    cross-linguistic study on the effect of information structure on linguistic form.
    The first study is looking at the basic effects of contrast on constituent order
    and prosody in language production in English and Basque, while later experiments
    will focus on common vs. privileged ground.
