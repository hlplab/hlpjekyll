    The stunning ability to communicate abstract messages is a
    quintessential human trait that uniquely defines us in the animal
    kingdom. At the same time, human language is a complex behavior that
    presumably draws in large parts on evolutionarily younger
    neural/cognitive systems. Research in the Human Language Processing
    (HLP) Lab seeks to understand the computational cognitive systems that
    allow the human brain to communicate information at a rate and
    complexity that far exceeds that of other animals.<br/>

    How can one estimate the Type I and II error rates of typological
    analysis? How can one model genealogical dependencies between languages
    without loss of power? How can one estimate the effects of language contact?
    In some of our work, we have discussed the used of multi-level models
    for typological research. Power analyses can be conducted by repeatedly
    sampling from plausible pseudo-world (see Figure which shows one such pseudo-world).
    We have introduced and tested simple algorithms that capture most
    variance in typological properties due to language contact.

    To understand each other, we must infer messages from the linguistic
    signal, which is often perturbed by noise. Our brain seems to overcome
    this problem by drawing on implicit knowledge about the distribution
    of signals and linguistic categories. Going further, some research
    from our lab suggests that listeners and readers can adapt their
    expectations about these distributions based on recent input. This
    is a critical ability, allowing efficient processing even in the
    face of inter-talker variability in pronunciation, as well as lexical
    and syntactic preferences.

    Example of cross-talker vowel variability before (left) and after (right)
    normalizing for differences in vocal-tract length based on F3. **Top Panel**:
    the average vowel space for adult male and adult female talkers in the
    vowel corpus collected by Hillenbrand et al. (1995). Talkers in this
    corpus are from the Northern dialect region of American English. **Bottom Panel**:
    the degree of overlap among adult male productions of /ʊ/ and adult female
    productions of /u/. Plots show individual vowel tokens (small dots),
    category means (large dots), and 95% confidence ellipses. Note that the
    unnormalized male and female vowel spaces (**top left panel**) have approximately
    the same geometric configuration, but the male vowels are characterized by
    comparatively lower absolute F1 and F2 values, which reflects the fact that longer
    vocal tracts resonate at lower frequencies than shorter vocal tracts.
    As a result, the distribution of adult male tokens of /ʊ/ is highly
    overlapping with the distribution of adult female tokens of /u/ in
    F1xF2 space (**bottom left panel**). That is, the same acoustic information
    maps onto different phonological categories with different probabilities
    depending on the talker’s sex. Hence neither F1 nor F2 provides reliable
    information for discriminating these vowel categories across talker sex.
    Normalizing F1 and F2 based on F3
    (which is correlated with vocal tract length) considerably reduces
    the difference between the average male and female vowel spaces (<strong>top
    right panel</strong>), while preserving the overall shape of the space (i.e.,
    the relative position of vowels). As a result of F3-normalization,
    tokens of /ʊ/ and /u/ are discriminable within and across talker sex.

- heading: Alignment

  text: >
    When we interact with one another, we tend to align our behaviors, including
    the way we talk. Linguistic alignment is due, at least in part, to automatic
    and subconscious aspects of language production, but is also influenced by
    social factors like one's attitude toward their interlocutor. Using a novel
    web-based paradigm, we investigated how speakers adapt (align or potentially
    anti-align) their sentence productions in response to their environment.

    The figure shows mixed logit model predictions for social factors that affect
    syntactic alignment (i.e., the tendency of participants to use the same sentence
    structures that they've heard other talkers produce). PO = the prepositional
    object structure (i.e., give [the object] [to the recipient]). DO = the double
    object structure (i.e., give [the recipient] [the object]). Hearing another
    talker produce either DO or PO structures increased the likelihood that
    participants would subsequently use the same sentence structure (i.e., overall
    alignment). However, the degree of alignment was influenced by a range of
    social factors, including perceived interpersonal similarity. Note that
    alignment rates were never reliably below baseline (i.e., no anti-alignment).
    Together, these results suggest that alignment is largely automatic but
    socially mediated.
