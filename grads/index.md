title: Graduate Students and Post-docs
---

If the work done in our lab interests you, we invite you to [apply to the department
of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/programs/graduate/how-to.html)
(University of Rochester). Admissions are handled centrally ( i.e. all faculty members
of department together decide who will be admitted), and you do not have to commit
to one faculty member in your application, but you should clearly describe what you
are interested in and what your research projects would be.

Post-docs can apply through training grants via the Brain and Cognitive Sciences
department or to research grants of individual faculty or they can apply for their
own funding (best done in collaboration with the faculty member you would want to
work with; see funding link below)
