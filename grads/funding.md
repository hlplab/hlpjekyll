## Funding to come to the lab

Graduate students in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester
are funded via a mixture of training grants, university fellowships, and individual
research grants. All graduate students in the program are guaranteed 5 years of
funding (graduate students are expected to work as a teaching assistant to BCS
classes 3 of the 10 semesters). Post-doctoral fellows are funding via training
grants through the department or research grants.

  * [NIH post-doctoral and graduate fellowships](http://grants.nih.gov/training/extramural.htm)
  provide generous funding for research at US research universities (see also the
  career development grants). You can apply for funding for your own project at
  potentially multiple institutions.These fellowships are also available to non-US
  citizens. Most of these fellowships do, however, have a strong focus on life
  and health sciences.
  * [Human Frontier Science](http://www.hfsp.org/about/AboutProg.php) post-doctoral
  fellowships for international collaborations and post-doc from other countries
  coming to the US (for at least part of their post-doc) or US citizens going abroad.
  HFS also provides career development and young faculty grants, as well as regular
  research grants of up to $US450,000 per year. HFS is focused on funding research
  in the life sciences (including e.g. chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering).
  * [Searle scholars program](http://www.searlescholars.net/) young researchers
  grants for research in the biomedical sciences and chemistry: .
  * [Computing Innovations Fellows Project](http://cifellows.org/) provides funding
  for one or two year postdocs in computing fields. [Our CI Fellows page](http://cifellows.org/match/t-florian-jaeger-at-human-language-lab-brain-and-cognitive-sciences-and-computer-science-university-of-rochester/)
  * If you're from Germany, you may consider the [DAAD](http://www.daad.org/) short-term
  visiting grants for graduate students and post-docs.
  * [The Jacob K. Javits Fellowships Program](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/jacobjavits/index.html)
  provides fellowships to students of superior academic ability—selected on the
  basis of demonstrated achievement, financial need, and exceptional promise—to
  undertake study at the doctoral and Master of Fine Arts level in selected fields
  of arts, humanities, and social sciences.
  * [Ford Foundation Fellowships Programs](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm).
  Predoctoral, Dissertation, and Postdoctoral fellowships available.
  * [Visits and research collaborations to HLP Lab for WUN members](http://www.rochester.edu/research/icf/)

### For undergraduates preparing for graduate school / Early graduate school

  * [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/). These are given
  based on research experience, promise of the proposed research program, and broader
  impact, such as community involvement, teaching, etc. (yes, they actually pay
  attention to that). If you decide to take a year or two off before applying
  to Ph.D. programs, you can still apply for nationally competitive graduate-study
  fellowships. They are not deferrable, so you'd wait to apply for them in the
  fall that you also plan to submit your graduate admission applications.
  * Howard Hughes Medical Institute [International Student Research Fellowship](http://www.hhmi.org/grants/individuals/intl_fellows.html).
  Three year fellowship for international students (in biomedical-related fields
    including biology, chemistry, physics, math, computer science, engineering,
    and plant biology—as well as interdisciplinary research). Open to 2nd or 3rd
    year PhD students who are ineligible for fellowships or training grants
    through U.S. federal agencies.

## Other funding
