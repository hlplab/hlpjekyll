        variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy,
        choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I
        show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to
        proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss
        conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by
        modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e.
        logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data
        and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit
        models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I
        describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for
        binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. &
        Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed
        models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9–25]),

        to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis.

This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers’ preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers’ preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.}

    Abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker’s /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker’s /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.}

  abstract = {Grammatical encoding is one of the earliest stages in linguistic encoding. One broadly accepted view holds that grammatical encoding is primarily or exclusively affected by production ease, rather than communicative considerations. This contrasts with proposals that speakers’ preferences during grammatical encoding reflect a trade-off between production ease and communicative goals. In three recall sentence production experiments, we investigate Japanese speakers’ production of optional object case-marking. Case-marking conveys information about the intended sentence interpretation, facilitating comprehension, but it also increases production effort. We find that Japanese speakers are more likely to produce case-marking when the properties of the sentence would otherwise bias comprehenders against the intended interpretation. Experiment 1 observes this effect based on the animacy of the object. Experiments 2 and 3 find the same effect based on the plausibility of the intended grammatical function assignment, even when animacy is held constant. We discuss how speakers might achieve this type of trade-off. In addition to evidencing the role of communicative pressures during even the earliest stages of language production, the results inform linguistic typology, where similar patterns have been observed in obligatory (differential) case-marking.}

    Abstract = {Tests of readers’ judgments regarding optional ‘that’ introducing relative and complement clauses provide evidence that fine-grained probabilistic knowledge is involved in such judgments and is arguably part of linguistic competence. Previous studies argue that probabilistic factors involved in production also influence judgment, but the predictive models involved here turn most significantly on the highly gradient predictability of an embedded clause. Lab tests were also replicated with crowdsourced populations with significantly correlated results. These results suggest that competence grammar includes not only some degree of probabilistic information, as suggested by prior work, but even access to rather fine-grained probability distributions.},
