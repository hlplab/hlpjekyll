    Abstract = {Acoustic and contextual cues to linguistic categories (e.g., phonemes
    or words) tend to be temporally distributed across the speech signal. Optimal
    cue integration thus requires maintenance of subcategorical information over
    time. At the same time, previous work suggests that finite sensory memory or
    processing capacity strongly limits how much subcategorical information can
    be maintained (or for how long). We argue that previous work might have
    over-interpreted the role of these limitations. In two perception experiments,
    we find no limit in the ability to maintain subcategorical information. We also
    find that maintenance seems to be the default, neither limited to perceptually
    particularly ambiguous signals, nor a learned strategy specific to our experiment.
    In contrast, listen-ers' decision for how long to delay categorization, we find,
    is a function of perceptual ambiguity. It is therefore crucial to distinguish
    between in-principle abilities (even when they reflect default processing),
    and decisions made within the bounds of those abilities.},

  abstract = {The number of phonological neighbours to a word (PND) can affect its lexical planning and pronunciation. Similar parallel effects on planning and articulation have been observed for other lexical variables, such as a word's contextual predictability. Such parallelism is frequently taken to indicate that effects on articulation are mediated by effects on the time course of lexical planning. We test this mediation assumption for PND and find it unsupported. In a picture naming experiment, we measure speech onset latencies (planning), word durations, and vowel dispersion (articulation). We find that PND predicts both latencies and durations. Further, latencies predict durations. However, the effects of PND and latency on duration are independent: parallel effects do not imply mediation. We discuss the consequences for accounts of lexical planning, articulation, and the link between them. In particular, our results suggest that ease of planning does not explain effects of PND on articulation.}

  abstract = "We ask whether speakers can adapt their productions when feedback from their interlocutors suggests that previous productions were perceptually confusable. To address this question, we use a novel web-based task-oriented paradigm for speech recording, in which participants produce instructions towards a (simulated) partner with naturalistic response times. We manipulate (1) whether a target word with a voiceless plosive (e.g., pill) occurs in the presence of a voiced competitor (bill) or an unrelated word (food) and (2) whether or not the simulated partner occasionally misunderstands the target word. Speakers hyper-articulated the target word when a voiced competitor was present. Moreover, the size of the hyper-articulation effect was nearly doubled when partners occasionally misunderstood the instruction. A novel type of distributional analysis further suggests that hyper-articulation did not change the target of production, but rather reduced the probability of perceptually ambiguous or confusable productions. These results were obtained in the absence of explicit clarification requests, and persisted across words and over trials. Our findings suggest that speakers adapt their pronunciations based on the perceived communicative success of their previous productions in the current environment. We discuss why speakers make adaptive changes to their speech and what mechanisms might underlie speakers’ ability to do so. "

  abstract = {Across languages of the world, some grammatical patterns have been argued to be more common than expected by chance. These are sometimes referred to as (statistical) language universals. One such universal is the correlation between constituent order freedom and the presence of a case system in a language. Here, we explore whether this correlation can be explained by a bias to balance production effort and informativity of cues to grammatical function. Two groups of learners were presented with miniature artificial languages containing optional case marking and either flexible or fixed constituent order. Learners of the flexible order language used case marking significantly more often. This result parallels the typological correlation between constituent order flexibility and the presence of case marking in a language and provides a possible explanation for the historical development of Old English to Modern English, from flexible constituent order with case marking to relatively fixed order without case marking. In addition, learners of the flexible order language conditioned case marking on constituent order, using more case marking with the cross-linguistically less frequent order, again mirroring typological data. These results suggest that some cross-linguistic generalizations originate in functionally motivated biases operating during language learning.}

  Abstract = {Recently processed syntactic information is likely to play a fundamental role in online sentence comprehension. For example, there is now a good deal of evidence that the processing of a syntactic structure (the target) is facilitated if the same structure was processed on the immediately preceding trial (the prime), a phenomenon known as structural priming. However, compared with structural priming in production, structural priming in comprehension remains relatively understudied. We investigate an aspect of structural priming in comprehension that is comparatively well understood in production but has received little attention in comprehension: the cumulative effect of structural primes on subsequently processed sentences. We further ask whether this effect is modulated by lexical overlap between preceding primes and the target. In 3 self-paced reading experiments, we find that structural priming effects in comprehension are cumulative and of similar magnitude both with and without lexical overlap. We discuss the relevance of our results to questions about the relationship between recent experience and online language processing.}

        widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome
        variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy,
        choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I
        show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to
        proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss
        conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by
        modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e.
        logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data
        and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit
        models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I
        describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for
        binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. &
        Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed
        models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9–25]),
        which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability
        to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis.
        Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the
        different statistical methods.},

This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers’ preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers’ preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.}

    Abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker’s /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker’s /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.}

Traditionally, selective adaptation is seen as a mechanistic property of the speech perception system, and attributed to fatigue in acoustic-phonetic feature detectors.

We argue that selective adaptation is better thought of as a computational property of the speech perception system. Drawing on a common thread in recent work on both non-linguistic sensory adaptation and plasticity in language comprehension, we furthermore propose that selective adaptation can be seen as a consequence of distributional learning across multiple levels of representation. This proposal opens up new questions for research on selective adaptation itself, and also suggests that selective adaptation can be an important bridge between work on adaptation in low-level sensory systems and the complicated plasticity of the adult language comprehension system.}

We argue that the bulk of behavioural and neural evidence suggests that we predict probabilistically and at multiple levels and grains of representation. We also argue that we can, in principle, use higher-level inferences to predictively pre-activate information at multiple lower representational levels. We suggest that the degree and level of predictive pre-activation might be a function of its expected utility, which, in turn, may depend on comprehenders’ goals and their estimates of the relative reliability of their prior knowledge and the bottom-up input. Finally, we argue that all these properties of language understanding can be naturally explained and productively explored within a multi-representational hierarchical actively generative architecture whose goal is to infer the message intended by the producer, and in which predictions play a crucial role in explaining the bottom-up input.},

One broadly accepted view holds that grammatical encoding is primarily or exclusively affected by production ease, rather than communicative considerations. This contrasts with proposals that speakers’ preferences during grammatical encoding reflect a trade-off between production ease and communicative goals. In three recall sentence production experiments, we investigate Japanese speakers’ production of optional object case-marking. Case-marking conveys information about the intended sentence interpretation, facilitating comprehension, but it also increases production effort. We find that Japanese speakers are more likely to produce case-marking when the properties of the sentence would otherwise bias comprehenders against the intended interpretation. Experiment 1 observes this effect based on the animacy of the object. Experiments 2 and 3 find the same effect based on the plausibility of the intended grammatical function assignment, even when animacy is held constant. We discuss how speakers might achieve this type of trade-off. In addition to evidencing the role of communicative pressures during even the earliest stages of language production, the results inform linguistic typology, where similar patterns have been observed in obligatory (differential) case-marking.}

              read a sentence, they use their statistical experience with their language to generate predictions
              about upcoming syntactic structure. This study examines how sentence processing is affected by
              readers’ uncertainty about those expectations. In a self-paced reading study, we use lexical subcategorization
              distributions to factorially manipulate both the strength of expectations and the uncertainty
              about them. We compare two types of uncertainty: uncertainty about the verb’s complement, reflecting
              the next prediction step; and uncertainty about the full sentence, reflecting an unbounded number
              of prediction steps. We find that uncertainty about the full structure, but not about the next step, was
              a significant predictor of processing difficulty: Greater reduction in uncertainty was correlated with
              increased reading times (RTs). We additionally replicated previously observed effects of expectation
              violation (surprisal), orthogonal to the effect of uncertainty. This suggests that both surprisal and
              uncertainty affect human RTs. We discuss the consequences for theories of sentence comprehension.},

  abstract = {We present a framework of second and additional language (L2/Ln) acquisition motivated by recent work on socio-indexical knowledge in first language (L1) processing. The distribution of linguistic categories covaries with socio-indexical variables (e.g., talker identity, gender, dialects). We summarize evidence that implicit probabilistic knowledge of this covariance is critical to L1 processing, and propose that L2/Ln learning uses the same type of socio-indexical information to probabilistically infer latent hierarchical structure over previously learned and new languages. This structure guides the acquisition of new languages based on their inferred place within that hierarchy and is itself continuously revised based on new input from any language. This proposal unifies L1 processing and L2/Ln acquisition as probabilistic inference under uncertainty over socio-indexical structure. It also offers a new perspective on crosslinguistic influences during L2/Ln learning, accommodating gradient and continued transfer (both negative and positive) from previously learned to novel languages, and vice versa.}

  either was or was not available as an alternative in the context. The results
  indicate that talkers enhance the durational cues associated with the word-final
  voicing contrast based on whether the context requires it, and that this can
  involve both elongation as well as shortening, depending on what enhances the
  contextually-relevant contrast. This suggests that talkers are capable of targeted,
  context-sensitive temporal enhancements.}

  Abstract = {How fast can listeners adapt to unfamiliar foreign accents? Clarke and Garrett 
             [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116, 3647–3658 (2004)] (CG04) reported that native-English 
             listeners adapted to foreign-accented English within a minute, demonstrating improved 
             processing of spoken words. In two web-based experiments that closely follow the design 
             of CG04, the effects of rapid accent adaptation are examined and its generalization is 
             explored across talkers. Experiment 1 replicated the core finding of CG04 that initial 
             perceptual difficulty with foreign-accented speech can be attenuated rapidly by a brief 
             period of exposure to an accented talker. Importantly, listeners showed both faster 
             (replicating CG04) and more accurate (extending CG04) comprehension of this talker. 
             Experiment 2 revealed evidence that such adaptation transferred to a different talker 
             of a same accent. These results highlight the rapidity of short-term accent adaptation and 
             raise new questions about the underlying mechanism. It is suggested that the web-based 
             paradigm provides a useful tool for investigations in speech adaptation.},

  Abstract = {Linguistic meaning has long been recognized to be highly context-dependent. Quantifiers like many and some provide a particularly clear example of context-dependence. For example, the interpretation of quantifiers requires listeners to determine the relevant domain and scale. We focus on another type of context-dependence that quantifiers share with other lexical items: talker variability. Different talkers might use quantifiers with different interpretations in mind. We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants’ expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure. We first established that the mapping of some and many onto quantities (candies in a bowl) is variable both within and between participants. We then examined whether and how listeners’ expectations about quantifier use adapts with exposure to talkers who use quantifiers in different ways. The results demonstrate that listeners can adapt to talker-specific biases in both how often and with what intended meaning many and some are used.},
