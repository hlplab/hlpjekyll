**Interested in participating in one of our experiments?** We are always looking
for participants. Depending on which study you get assigned to, you may get to
learn new artificial languages, get to use an eye-tracker, or simply listen to or
read sentences or describe pictures. Before the study, you will be informed about
your rights, as well as potential risks and benefits of the experiment (in our
experiments, usually none outside to the pleasure to participate in science and
the fact that you will receive payment for the time you spend in the lab). After
the study we will tell you what we are interested in and why we are conducted
the research you participated in. These experiment have been approved by the
Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB #24018 and #45955).

You will have a chance to experience first hand how we study language acquisition,
production, and comprehension. How do we integrate complex auditory information
within fractions of a second while listening to language? How do we manage to
translate our thoughts into a sequence of sounds, which -most of the time- conveys
our thoughts to our listeners? Why are languages across the world the way they are
- what makes them likely to share certain properties but not necessarily others?

**You can now** [ENROLL ON-LINE IN OUR EXPERIMENTS](http://urochester-bcs.sona-systems.com/).
You will have to register for a SONA account. This will allow you to select between
different experiments and times and to automatically schedule an experiment. Your
information will never be given to third parties and we will never link your results
to your name or other identifying information.

**If you have questions**, please feel free to contact us either via hlpstudy@gmail.com
or by phone at (585) 273-1050. You can also email us to enroll in a study if you
prefer that to our online registration through SONA. In that case, just drop us
a line, e.g., "I am interested in participating in one of your studies.". Our
friendly research assistants will contact you with more details.

**If you have any questions about your rights in participating in our experiments**,
feel free to contact us at (585) 273-1050 or you may contact the Human Subjects
Protection Specialist at the University of Rochester Research Subjects Review
Board.
