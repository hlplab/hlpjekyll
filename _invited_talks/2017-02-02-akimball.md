title: Categorical vs. Episodic Memory for Pitch Accents in American English
---
Phonological accounts of speech perception postulate that listeners map variable
instances of speech to categorical features and remember only those categories.
Other research maintains that listeners perceive and remember subcategorical
phonetic detail. Our study probes memory to investigate the reality of categorical
encoding for prosodyâ€”when listeners hear a pitch accent, what do they remember?
Two types of prosodic variation are tested: phonological variation (presence
vs. absence of a pitch accent), and variation in phonetic cues to pitch accent
(F0 peak, word duration). We report results from six experiments that test
memory for phonological pitch accent vs. phonetic cues. Our results suggest
that listeners encode both categorical distinctions and phonetic detail in
memory, but categorical distinctions are more reliably retrieved than cues
in later tests of episodic memory. They also show that listeners may vary
in the degree to which they remember prosodic detail.
