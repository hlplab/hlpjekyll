      Models of retrieval in sentence comprehension: A computational evaluation
      using Bayesian hierarchical modeling
---
Research on similarity-based interference has provided extensive evidence
that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a
cue-based retrieval mechanism. There are two different models that can account
for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a
retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval
cue: Lewis and Vasishth’s (2005) activation-based model and McElree’s (2000)
direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost
interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences
in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The
activation-based model follows the assumptions of the ACT-R framework, and
its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of
evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval
is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of
accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory
where only the probability of retrieval can be affected, while the retrieval
time is constant; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of
the possibility of backtracking and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented
both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them
and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under
the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that
this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving
as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the
ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation
model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of
incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances
for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good
as the one of the direct access model.
