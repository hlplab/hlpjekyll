    Uniformity in talker-specific phonetic realization: Evidence from sibilant
    fricatives in American English and Czech
---
The acoustic-phonetic properties of speech sounds vary substantially across
languages, and even across talkers within a single language. There is, however,
considerable evidence that phonetic properties that the realizations of different
speech sounds do not vary independently but are highly structured (mutually
predictable). Evidence for structured variation of this type can be found
in the covariation of vowels in the F1xF2 plane, with talkers forming relatively
congruent but shifted formant patterns, but shifted vowel spaces (e.g., Joos,
1948; Nearey, 1978), and covariation of voice onset time (VOT), as talkers
primarily differ in overall mean VOT, especially among the aspirated stops
[pʰ tʰ kʰ] (e.g., Chodroff & Wilson, 2017). Cases of structured variation
reveal that there are constraints on phonetic variation in language- and
talker-specific sound systems (e.g., Liljencrants & Lindblom, 1972).

This talk examines the predictions of two uniformity constraints that require
similar (or uniform) phonetic realization of distinctive features across members
of a natural class. To evaluate the predictions, I present data on the realization
of sibilant fricatives across talkers of American English and Czech. The findings
support the hypothesis that talker variation is highly constrained, and also
have important implications for rapid perceptual adaptation to novel talkers.
