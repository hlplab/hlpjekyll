{% blockquote University of Rochester Newscenter - May 19th, 2015 http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/thinking-alike-changes-the-conversation-103682/ %}

Now a new study shows that people with similar views tend to more closely mirror, or align, each other’s speech patterns. In addition, people who are better at compromising align more closely.
