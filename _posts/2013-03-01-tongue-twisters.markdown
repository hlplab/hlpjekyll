Former University of Rochester students Catie Hilliard ’10 and Katrina Furth ’10
 recently saw two research papers written during their undergraduate studies
 published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and
 Cognition and Frontiers in Psychology. Working with Florian Jaeger, Wilmot
 Assistant Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Furth
 and Hilliard examined how word choice is affected by phonological overlap, or
 how the sounds of words affect how we choose them in everyday conversation.
