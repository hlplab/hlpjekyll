"Our research shows that humans choose to reshape language when the structure
is either overly redundant or confusing", says T. Florian Jaeger, the Wilmot
Assistant Professor of the Sciences at Rochester and co-author of a study published
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Oct. 15. "This study
suggests that we prefer languages that on average convey information efficiently,
striking a balance between effort and clarity."
