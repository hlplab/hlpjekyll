              <h3>Research Statement</h3>
              <p>The stunning ability to communicate abstract messages is a
              quintessential human trait that uniquely defines us in the animal
              kingdom. At the same time, human language is a complex behavior that
              presumably draws in large parts on evolutionarily younger
              neural/cognitive systems. Research in the Human Language Processing
              (HLP) Lab seeks to understand the computational cognitive systems that
              allow the human brain to communicate information at a rate and
              complexity that far exceeds that of other animals.

              <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/pics/family-distribution-sample5779_small.jpg" alt="family distribution"/>
              <p>How can one estimate the Type I and II error rates of typological
                analysis? How can one model genealogical dependencies between languages
                without loss of power? How can one estimate the effects of language contact?
                In some of our work, we have discussed the used of multi-level models
                for typological research. Power analyses can be conducted by repeatedly
                sampling from plausible pseudo-world (see Figure which shows one such pseudo-world).
                We have introduced and tested simple algorithms that capture most
                variance in typological properties due to language contact.</p>

              <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/pics/noisy_channel+adaptation.png" alt="noisy channel + adaptation"/>
              <p>To understand each other, we must infer messages from the linguistic
                signal, which is often perturbed by noise. Our brain seems to overcome
                this problem by drawing on implicit knowledge about the distribution
                of signals and linguistic categories. Going further, some research
                from our lab suggests that listeners and readers can adapt their
                expectations about these distributions based on recent input. This
                is a critical ability, allowing efficient processing even in the
                face of inter-talker variability in pronunciation, as well as lexical
                and syntactic preferences.</p>

              <p>Example of cross-talker vowel variability before (left) and after (right)
              normalizing for differences in vocal-tract length based on F3. <strong>Top Panel</strong>:
              the average vowel space for adult male and adult female talkers in the
              vowel corpus collected by Hillenbrand et al. (1995). Talkers in this
              corpus are from the Northern dialect region of American English. <strong>Middle Panel</strong>:
               the degree of overlap among adult male productions of /ʊ/ and adult female
               productions of /u/. Plots show individual vowel tokens (small dots),
               category means (large dots), and 95% confidence ellipses. <strong>Bottom Panel</strong>:
               pair-wise vowel discriminability for select vowel pairs within and across talker sex
               (i.e., distance between category means scaled by the square root of
               the sum of category variances). Note that the unnormalized male and
               female vowel spaces (<strong>top left panel</strong>) have approximately the same geometric
               configuration, but the male vowels are characterized by comparatively
               lower absolute F1 and F2 values, which reflects the fact that longer
               vocal tracts resonate at lower frequencies than shorter vocal tracts.
               As a result, the distribution of adult male tokens of /ʊ/ is highly
               overlapping with the distribution of adult female tokens of /u/ in
               F1xF2 space (<strong>middle left panel</strong>). That is, the same acoustic information
               maps onto different phonological categories with different probabilities
               depending on the talker’s sex. Hence neither F1 nor F2 provides reliable
               information for discriminating these vowel categories across talker sex
               (<strong>bottom left panel</strong>, middle two bars). Normalizing F1 and F2 based on F3
               (which is correlated with vocal tract length) considerably reduces
               the difference between the average male and female vowel spaces (<strong>top
               right panel</strong>), while preserving the overall shape of the space (i.e.,
               the relative position of vowels). As a result of F3-normalization,
               tokens of /ʊ/ and /u/ are discriminable within and across talker sex
               (<strong>bottom right panel</strong>).</p>
